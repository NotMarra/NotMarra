# Hi there! 👋

I'm a developer passionate about game development and creating interactive experiences.

## 🎮 What I'm Working On

Currently working on my own game project! I'm excited to bring my ideas to life and share the journey with the community.

## 💻 Tech Stack

- **C#** - Currently my go-to language, loving every moment of coding with it
- **Java** - Built experience through Minecraft plugin development
- **Game Development** - Exploring game engines and mechanics

## 🔨 Background

I've spent time developing Minecraft plugins in Java, which gave me a solid foundation in:
- Plugin architecture and event-driven programming
- Server-side game logic
- Working with existing game APIs
- Community-focused development

Now I'm channeling that experience into C# and broader game development.

## 🌱 Currently Learning

- Advanced C# patterns and best practices
- Game engine development
- Game design principles
- Performance optimization for games
